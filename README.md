## Introduction

Water quality is crucial for public health, and the potability of water is a key concern for both individuals and public utilities. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict water potability based on various water quality parameters. By analyzing historical water quality data, we can make predictions and help identify potential issues before they become a threat to human health.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the [Water Quality Data](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability) on Kaggle. It contains various water quality parameters, such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, and more. You can download the dataset and save it as `water_quality.csv` in the project directory.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The Jupyter notebook provides detailed information on how data is cleaned and prepared for modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You can explore the water quality dataset and gain insights through data visualization in the provided notebook. Analyze the distribution of different parameters, correlations, and more.

## Model Development

We use machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for water potability. You can find the code for model training and evaluation in the Jupyter notebook.

## Model Evaluation

The notebook also includes the evaluation of the model's performance, including metrics like mean_squared_error. This will help you assess the model's ability to predict water potability accurately.
